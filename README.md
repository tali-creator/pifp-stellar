# Proof-of-Impact Funding Protocol (PIFP)

**Trust-minimized global funding. Money moves only when verifiable impact occurs.**

## Why PIFP?

Traditional donations rely on trust. PIFP uses **Stellar smart contracts** to lock funds until proof of impact is verified, replacing intermediaries with cryptographic accountability.

## How It Works

1.  **Project Created**: Creator sets funding goal and proof requirements.
2.  **Funded**: Donors deposit Bitcoin-backed assets into a Stellar pool (anonymously).
3.  **Proof**: Implementer submits proof (photos, data) to the Oracle.
4.  **Verified & Released**: Smart contract verifies proof hash and releases funds.

## Tech Stack

- **Stellar/Soroban**: Smart contract logic for conditional release.
- **Rust**: Backend oracle for proof hashing and verification.
- **React**: Frontend for project creation and funding.

## Security

- **Non-custodial**: Funds locked in contracts, not by us.
- **Privacy**: Commitment schemes hide donor identity.
- **Authentication**: Wallet signatures + OTP for critical actions.

## Impact

Zero corruption. 100% Transparency. Validated outcomes for charity and development.

## Testing

The contract logic is extensively covered by a comprehensive test suite. The test coverage validates the core lifecycle of project creation, external deposits, and oracle proof-verification logic for security boundaries.
To run the automated tests using the Soroban testutils feature:

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path contracts/pifp_protocol/Cargo.toml
```
